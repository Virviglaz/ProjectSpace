/*
 * As a next step we need to find our available display devices. libdrm provides
 * a drmModeRes structure that contains all the needed information. We can
 * retrieve it via drmModeGetResources(fd) and free it via
 * drmModeFreeResources(res) again.
 *
 * A physical connector on your graphics card is called a "connector". You can
 * plug a monitor into it and control what is displayed. We are definitely
 * interested in what connectors are currently used, so we simply iterate
 * through the list of connectors and try to display a test-picture on each
 * available monitor.
 * However, this isn't as easy as it sounds. First, we need to check whether the
 * connector is actually used (a monitor is plugged in and turned on). Then we
 * need to find a CRTC that can control this connector. CRTCs are described
 * later on. After that we create a framebuffer object. If we have all this, we
 * can mmap() the framebuffer and draw a test-picture into it. Then we can tell
 * the DRM device to show the framebuffer on the given CRTC with the selected
 * connector.
 *
 * As we want to draw moving pictures on the framebuffer, we actually have to
 * remember all these settings. Therefore, we create one "struct modeset_dev"
 * object for each connector+crtc+framebuffer pair that we successfully
 * initialized and push it into the global device-list.
 *
 * Each field of this structure is described when it is first used. But as a
 * summary:
 * "struct modeset_dev" contains: {
 *  - @next: points to the next device in the single-linked list
 *
 *  - @width: width of our buffer object
 *  - @height: height of our buffer object
 *  - @stride: stride value of our buffer object
 *  - @size: size of the memory mapped buffer
 *  - @handle: a DRM handle to the buffer object that we can draw into
 *  - @map: pointer to the memory mapped buffer
 *
 *  - @mode: the display mode that we want to use
 *  - @fb: a framebuffer handle with our buffer object as scanout buffer
 *  - @conn: the connector ID that we want to use with this buffer
 *  - @crtc: the crtc ID that we want to use with this connector
 *  - @saved_crtc: the configuration of the crtc before we changed it. We use it
 *                 so we can restore the same mode when we exit.

/*
 * Now we dig deeper into setting up a single connector. As described earlier,
 * we need to check several things first:
 *   * If the connector is currently unused, that is, no monitor is plugged in,
 *     then we can ignore it.
 *   * We have to find a suitable resolution and refresh-rate. All this is
 *     available in drmModeModeInfo structures saved for each crtc. We simply
 *     use the first mode that is available. This is always the mode with the
 *     highest resolution.
 *     A more sophisticated mode-selection should be done in real applications,
 *     though.
 *   * Then we need to find an CRTC that can drive this connector. A CRTC is an
 *     internal resource of each graphics-card. The number of CRTCs controls how
 *     many connectors can be controlled indepedently. That is, a graphics-cards
 *     may have more connectors than CRTCs, which means, not all monitors can be
 *     controlled independently.
 *     There is actually the possibility to control multiple connectors via a
 *     single CRTC if the monitors should display the same content. However, we
 *     do not make use of this here.
 *     So think of connectors as pipelines to the connected monitors and the
 *     CRTCs are the controllers that manage which data goes to which pipeline.
 *     If there are more pipelines than CRTCs, then we cannot control all of
 *     them at the same time.
 *   * We need to create a framebuffer for this connector. A framebuffer is a
 *     memory buffer that we can write XRGB32 data into. So we use this to
 *     render our graphics and then the CRTC can scan-out this data from the
 *     framebuffer onto the monitor.

 * format that can be used for the chosen connector. We do not have to

 * and write it into the @dev structure.
 * But before iterating all available encoders, we first try the currently
 * active encoder+crtc on a connector to avoid a full modeset.
 *
 * However, before we can use a CRTC we must make sure that no other device,

 * modeset_create_fb(fd, dev): After we have found a crtc+connector+mode

 *   * We can create a so called "dumb buffer". This is a buffer that we can
 *     memory-map via mmap() and every driver supports this. We can use it for
 *     unaccelerated software rendering on the CPU.
 *   * We can use libgbm to create buffers available for hardware-acceleration.
 *     libgbm is an abstraction layer that creates these buffers for each
 *     available DRM driver. As there is no generic API for this, each driver
 *     provides its own way to create these buffers.
 *     We can then use such buffers to create OpenGL contexts with the mesa3D
 *     library.
 * We use the first solution here as it is much simpler and doesn't require any
 * external libraries. However, if you want to use hardware-acceleration via
 * OpenGL, it is actually pretty easy to create such buffers with libgbm and
 * libEGL. But this is beyond the scope of this document.
 *
 * So what we do is requesting a new dumb-buffer from the driver. We specify the
 * same size as the current mode that we selected for the connector.
 * Then we request the driver to prepare this buffer for memory mapping. After
 * that we perform the actual mmap() call. So we can now access the framebuffer
 * memory directly via the dev->map memory map.
